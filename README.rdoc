Where to put rest call to fyber?..
In a service FyberOffersApi

So when a user opens a page, request goes to server.
Request is processed by controller.
Controller will call FyberOffersApi to do an api call to Fyber services.

Huh? Hashkey needs to be calculated on each request.
I've been given a static api key. Have I been tricked?..
FyberOfferHashkey upcoming

Turns up api key is used to generate hashkey
